# DataHacks 2022 Submission
This project was created as a submission to [DataHacks 2022](http://datahacks.tech/). <br> The submission's report can be found [here](https://jonathanlo411.github.io/datahacks-2022/).
**Team Members**: _Jonathan Lo, Eric Wang, and Justin Liang_

## Tech Stack - Machine Learning (Neural Network)
Most of the detail is in the report but we use Python. EDA was done using the standard [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](https://pandas.pydata.org/) with some extra packages for data parsing and the like. Our ML data visualization are generated with [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) while general visualizations are done with [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). For our model, we cycled through [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) with [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).  

## Tech Stack - Website
The website is static so there is no backend. It was written in HTML/CSS and JS. We utilize `<iframe>`s for drop in our Plotly visualizations. Code blocks are made from scratch. We also utilize [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for the more meta visualizations about the project. All animations are just CSS `@keyframes`.
